\section{Introduction}

The 1995 movie Hackers~\cite{Wikipedia_contributors2024-zr} prescient predictions regarding the ease
of breaking into computing systems in cyberspace have came to fruition. The White House Office of
the National Cyber Director (ONCD) released a report calling for the technical community to
proactively reduce the attack surface in cyberspace with a two pronged approach. First we need to
address the root cause of many of the most heinous cyber attacks, memory unsafe programming
languages~\cite{United_States_Gov2024-pp}. Second, we need to establish better cybersecurity quality
metrics so we can have a better understanding of the cyber security landscape.

In the ever-evolving landscape of software development, the reliability and security of computer
systems stand as paramount concerns for all parties involved. Modern software is constructed by
building ever more complex abstractions. Each abstraction forms a layer that the next one it built
upon. Thus, if we aim to have a secure system we must peel back all the layers and tackle one of the
fundamental abstractions in computer science the programming language. Programming languages that
provided and enforce memory safety eliminate whole classes of bugs such as buffer overflows,
dangling pointers, and memory leaks which have been implicated in a myriad of security
vulnerabilities and system crashes.

This Systematic Literature Review (SLR) aims to provide a comprehensive and up-to-date analysis of
the existing body of research surrounding memory safety. By systematically reviewing and
synthesizing the wealth of knowledge accumulated in this field, we seek to uncover the current state
of understanding, identify emerging trends, and highlight gaps in our knowledge that warrant further
investigation.


\section{Research Methodology}

For our research methodolgy we followed the advice of Kitchenham and Charters~\cite{Stuart2007-cc}
and divided our review into the 3 discrete phases, planning the review, conducting the review, and
reporting the review results.

\subsection{Planning}

Before we start researching we must first confirm the need for a SLR. The recent report released by
ONCD~\cite{United_States_Gov2024-pp} has conveniently done this job for us by compiling a report
detailing the need for research in the domain of memory safety. While the ONCD report detailed a two
pronged approach for this SLR we will be focusing on a memory safe programming language,
specifically Rust.

\subsubsection{Research Questions}
We have defined the following research questions to drive this study.

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{RQ1:} How can \lstinline{unsafe} Rust derived from C be converted to safe Rust?
    \item \textbf{RQ2:} How can we build Rust bindings into core abstractions?
    \item \textbf{RQ3:} How can we better find vulnerabilities in \lstinline{unsafe} blocks
\end{itemize}
