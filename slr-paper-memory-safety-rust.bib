                  Santiago, Lorraine Bracco, and Fisher Stevens. The film
                  follows a group of high school hackers and their involvement
                  in an attempted theft. Made in the mid-1990s when the
                  Internet was just starting to become popular among the
                  general public, it reflects the ideals laid out in the Hacker
                  Manifesto quoted in the film: ``This is our world now... the
                  world of the electron and the switch... We exist without skin
                  color, without nationality, without religious bias... and you
                  call us criminals... Yes, I am a criminal. My crime is that
                  of curiosity.''",
