  abstract = "The Linux system has become an indispensable component of today's
              Internet services, network backbones, and IoT devices. The Linux
              kernel is primarily implemented in the C language for efficiency,
              creating opportunities for memory bugs and synchronization bugs.
              We introduce the use of the Rust programming language in kernel
              development, where the safety features of the Rust language are
              leveraged to prevent the introduction of memory bugs or
              synchronization bugs when writing kernel code. We showcase the
              key steps in developing a Linux kernel module in Rust and discuss
              how the memory bugs and synchronization bugs are prevented. The
              evaluation demonstrates that the performance overhead of the Rust
              kernel modules is on par with the C kernel modules.",

  abstract     = "With 65\% of recent Linux kernel vulnerabilities being the
                  result of memory unsafety (buffer overflows, pointers used
                  after being freed, etc.) and not logic errors, both kernel
                  developers and downstream users have wondered whether it's
                  possible to use a safer language than C for kernel
                  development. This talk will explore the presenters' work
                  building a framework for writing kernel modules in Rust and
                  accessing kernel APIs in safe Rust. In particular, the talk
                  will discuss some of the challenges of building
                  binary-compatible kernel modules in Rust, techniques for
                  working with existing C code, and how to design safe bindings
                  over raw kernel APIs. It will also discuss advantages and
                  difficulties for integrating Rust in upstream kernel
                  development and possible directions the upstream kernel
                  community could go.",
